<br><strong><span style="color:black">1.What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</span></strong></br>

<br>What I find interesting in IT is that IT requires and improves its learners’ problem-solving and logical thinking skills. I am kind of good at Math, which is also my most favorite subject. I love to work hard to solve Math problems. At first, when I started learning programming in the middle school, I did not understand what my teacher was teaching so I did not like it. Then, until I was at 11th grade, I had a chance to learn with my Informatics teacher. She taught me about Pascal. Thank to her way of teaching, I could get everything she had said and applied pretty well in my assignments. That was when I realized that programming has many points the same as Math. When I programed something, I had to check whether it went accurate or not. If it did not, I had to find out where it went wrong. This moment requires both problem-solving and logical thinking like Mathematics. After that, I started to fond of reading news about technologies, the people who have succeeded in this area, especially who are Vietnamese. I wondered how they did those amazing things. I wanted to develop applications, websites, joining in IT projects like that as well. Before attending to RMIT, I had worked as a tester for RTA Company for two weeks. They create online questionaires on their own app to go survey in order to collect more accurate information under strict management for their customers. It sounds like Google forms but it is much more complicated than them. As a tester, I had to check whether the information is the same as the questionaire on paper, the constraints are enough and logically right or not; I also had to report when there is a crash or an issue. Although this experience lasted in a very short amount of time, I already had an opportunity to understand how a technology company runs and I felt that I still want to learn how to create plenty of convenient products to advance people’s life.</br>

<br><strong><span style="color:black">2.Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</span></strong></br>

<br>I chose RMIT University as my next destination after high school because of three reasons. First, I can start to learn my program from the first semester. I do not have to learn the unnecessary courses as in many Vietnamese universities such as military, politics, P.E, etc. This will help me complete my study at university sooner and begin to earn the money by myself, which I aim for after finishing my study in university. Next, RMIT provides me the internationally academic environment. Every course in here is taught in English by professional lecturers, who have studied and lived abroad for several years. Therefore, my English skills could be improved, which makes me a lot more confident. Moreover, many companies nowadays highly demand for their employees’ English skill so having learned in international environment at university would be my advantage over the others. More importantly, learning IT, my chosen program, requires English skills of learners so well because everything in IT such as hardware, software, programming language, etc is set up in English. Due to that tendency, I think that RMIT is absolutely suitable with my need. Finally, I could have a chance to study abroad which I desire for after graduating from high school. RMIT offers their students an opportunity to study oversea by their exchange and transfer program. I believe that this is also one of the other students’ reasons why they chose RMIT.</br>

<br><strong><span style="color:black">3.What do you expect to learn during your studies?</span></strong></br>

<br>During my studies, I expect to learn how to program well because I am kind of new to programming. I just learned a little bit of Pascal, algorithms, HTML in the past years so I want to advance myself and be more professional. Then, I completely desire to be able to find out what my advantages are, which job is suitable to me the most, etc. I also want to learn about project manangement, teamwork. This is because when I was a tester, as I mentioned previously, I saw that everyone in the company always worked, communicated together to complete a project under the leader’s control. Therefore, I believe that project management and teamwork are two soft skills that benefit employees a lot. Lastly, I would love to get to know how to create and develop new IT project ideas from my both classmates and lecturers. This completely makes me be more creative.</br>
