<br><strong><span style="color:black">Overview:</span></strong></br>

<br>This project idea is to develop a website that could help people, especially students, orient their future career. This web collects users’ information such as their desire, hobbies, advantages, etc. Then, it will offer an appropriate path for users to identify their future career as exact and suitable as possible.</br>
</p>
									<p style="color:black">
<br><strong><span style="color:black">Motivation</span></strong></br>

<br>Nowadays, young people usually have difficulty in choosing their appropriate career. Most of them do not know which one is suitable with themselves, while the others have their own desire but they still wonder whether they can learn it.</br> 
<blockquote cite="https://journals.psu.edu/mentor/article/view/61278/60911">
<span style="color:black">“An estimated 20 to 50 percent of students enter college as “undecided” (Gordon, 1995) and an estimated 75 percent of students change their major at least once before graduation (Gordon, 1995). When looking at the statistics, it is obvious that choosing a major has serious implications for the majority of students, not just undecided ones. It is also important to note that “decided” students are not necessarily basing their decision of major on factual research and self-reflection.” - Liz Freedman:" The Developmental Disconnect in Choosing a Major: Why Institutions Should Prohibit Choice until Second Year"</span></blockquote>  
<span style="color:black"><br>Taking those reasons into consideration, I would like to build a website to mostly support them in solving those problems.</span>
</br>
</p>
									<p style="color:black">
<br><strong><span style="color:black">Description:</span></strong></br>
<br><i>-<u>Questionaires:</u></i></br> 
This is a very first step when users reach this website. They would be asked about their basic personal information such as their name, gender, hobbies, etc. Besides those information, the most important things we want to collect is their educational background similar to these questions, for example, below:
<ol style= "color:black">
  <li>Which school are you studying? (highschool? middle school?)</li>
  <li>Are you major in any subject at your school? If you are, are you satisfied with your major study? Otherwise, which subject are you interested in?</li>
  <li>What is your highest-graded subject? Do you like this subject? If you do, have you ever thought of choosing your future career related to this subject?</li>
…
</ol>
<br><span style="color:black">The next special question is to identify whether they have already decided their dream job or not. If they do not, we would offer some tests for them to support which one is suitable with them. On the other hand, if they have already had, we would offer some tests that could modify which basic skills are required for that job.
</span></br>
<span style="color:black"><br><i>-<u>Tests:</u></i></br>
There are two parts of tests:
<br>+ The first part is created for the users who have already had their dream jobs and would like to know more about its contents or to check which required skills for that job they already have, which they are still lack of. For example, creativity test for designing jobs, problem-solving test, critical and logically thinking test, etc.</br>
<br>+ The second part is for the person who still contemplate about their future job. This part includes MBTI test, the well-known and popular test people often use to refer while they are choosing their job, and the other tests that guide people to the appropriate job based on themselves. The test indicated in the first part may also be used for this group of users due to some particular purposes.</br>
<br>*<u>Notice:</u> These tests may be arranged differently afterwards. Also, there are possibly many more tests suggested.</br></span> 
<span style="color:black"><br><i>-<u>Challenges and Tutorials:</u></i></br>
Based on the results of the tests above, there would be some challenges or tutorials to enable users visualize, experience, and improve the demanding skill for a particular job. For example, one person got low points on the numeric reasoning test but they want to get the finance-related or science-related job. In that case, the website will give the users a list of challenges such as small games, quizzes, etc to practice, improve, and upgrade their point as well as their skill. The challenges would be range from the easy to difficult level. Besides, the website also contains some tutorials (online books, Youtube videos, etc) accumulated from the other sources.</span> 
</p>
<p>
<p style="color:black">
<br><strong><span style="color:black">Tools and Technologies:</span></strong></br>

<br>In order to build this website, I intend to use Django. This is an open-source framework written in Python, an all-purpose and convenient programming language developers would love to use. Moreover, throughout the web building process on this software, Python is the most used language. Django is free for all users. It also provides a more convenient way to program for web developers by its reusability and “pluggability” functions. This would give developers chances to reduce the amount of code they have to write, and increase the speed of development. In addition, Django’s goal is to make the creation of complicated, database-driven websites easier for developers. Those features are the reasons why I choose Django to develop this website.</br>
</p>
<p style="color:black">
<br><strong><span style="color:black">Skills Required:</span></strong></br>

<br>-Experience in programming Python and using Django to create a website. In addition, developer should also know about HTML and CSS because this is two basic language to form a website.</br>
-Creating attractive plus professional contents, especially for the challenges.
<br>-Researching, collecting, and offering accurate information for users.</br>
-Statistics Analysis (estimated) in order to accurately analyze the tests and questionaires results.<p>
<p style="color:black"><br><i class="fas fa-long-arrow-alt-right"></i><i><u> How feasible will it be to find the skills, software, and hardware required?</u></i></br>
All of the skills mentioned above are available nowadays. There are many classes, video tutorials, etc that teach those skills. Therefore, all of them are achievable. There are also people who are major in each of skill, thus it would more practical if this project is launched by a team in which each member excel at one particular skill. However, the largest obstacle  is that it would require a long period of time to collect the most accurate, trust-worthy information, create contents due to those information, and apply those contents to the website. Besides, for beginners who want to make this project, it also takes lots of time to achieve those skills.
</p>
	<p style="color:black">
<br><strong><span style="color:black">Outcome:</span></strong></br>
<br>If this project is successful, there would be a website with many tools where young people can surf on to make a reference in support to their career decision. This website cannot completely make a choice for users; however, it would provide users a closer approach to the career market with an obvious pathway rather than just giving the information. Of course, everything given by this website is only for reference purpose. Users do not have to do 100% the same as what suggested by the website. After experience through this website, I hope that users could no longer have difficulty in orienting their career.</br>
